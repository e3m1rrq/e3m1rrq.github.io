# Welcome! ðŸ‘‹
**Haven't you grown tired of regular, click-driven websites that just guide you along? See only what you want to see. That's why I've set up a console (terminal) themed website. I will use this site as my CV and e-portfolio in the present and future. But don't worry, the site will never stay like this. I will continually add more content and make it even more beautiful. So, the site will never die :).**

# I'm Looking Forward to Your Contributions ðŸ’œ
**If you have experience in web development or design, or if you'd like to contribute to my project, please don't hesitate to reach out. Your feedback, suggestions, and support are valuable to me and will help take the project to the next level.**

**Thank you, and I hope you enjoy exploring my website!**
